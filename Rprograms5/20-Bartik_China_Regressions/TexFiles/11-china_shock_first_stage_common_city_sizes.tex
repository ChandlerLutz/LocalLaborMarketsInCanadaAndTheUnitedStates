\item \textit{Notes:} See the notes for table \ref{tab:gradients}. Sample consists of 256 metro areas in the United States -- observed in 1990, 2000, and 2007 -- and 56 in  Canada -- observed  in  1991, 2000/1 and 2006/7. In both columns, controls include decadal fixed effects and census division (column (1), U.S.)  or region (column (2), Canada) fixed effects. Predicted imports per workers are constructed using imports from Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland (Other Countries). Imports from China to Other Countries for Canada are adjusted using the 1990 relative population between the U.S. and Canada (by multiplying by (27.79 / 249.6)). Cities are chosen so that 1990 24-59 metro population size has a common support. See the notes to table \ref{tab:summ_stats} for data sources and definitions. Regressions are  weighted by start of period population 24-59. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state/province level and are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicates statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.
